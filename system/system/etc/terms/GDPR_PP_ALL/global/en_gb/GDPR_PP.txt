This Policy applies only to information collected by LGE from your LGE mobile phone to perform an update of firmware via the “Firmware Over-the-Air” (FOTA) process (a “Software Update”). This Policy does not apply to any of LGE’s other products or services, including mobile apps offered or provided by LGE; nor does it apply to any products or services offered by third parties, including operating system providers, other content or application providers or your network carrier. All products and services beyond the scope of this Privacy Policy have their own policies on the collection, use, and sharing of personal information, which we strongly advise you to read. LGE is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices of third parties.

If you have recently purchased this mobile phone, it is necessary to perform a Software Update as described in this Privacy Policy before using it, in order to ensure that your mobile phone functions properly and has our most up-to-date features, functionalities, and security settings. If you have any queries, please contact us at the contact point indicated in this Policy.

This Policy is available for your review at any time at [Settings – System - About phone – Legal info – Legal Documents for LG Software – Privacy Policy].

All translations of this Privacy Policy document have been done to suit local requirements. In the event of a discrepancy between the English-language version and any non-English version, the English version of this Policy document shall take precedence, to the maximum extent permitted by the local law within your jurisdiction.


2.	Overview of FOTA Software Updates
From time to time, the LGE firmware on your mobile phone (the “Software”) may require updates or supplements provided by LGE, or LGE may provide add-on components to the Software. A Software Update will install new Software on your mobile phone in order to receive such updates, supplements and add-on components. Software Updates may add new features or functions and, in certain limited cases, may remove existing features or functions. After completing the Software Update, you may no longer use, and may not be able to roll back to, the previously installed version of the Software. 

Because the Software Update is performed via the FOTA process, you may incur additional charges if you download new Software over a cellular network, depending on your network carrier and service plan. If you wish to avoid using cellular network data for Software Updates, please select the “Wi-Fi Only” option under Settings. 

a.	Your options for managing future Software Updates
With the “Check automatically” function enabled, your mobile phone will check for new or updated Software from time to time and automatically download new or updated Software when it is available (“Check automatically” function). After installation of the Software, we will alert you by sending a pop-up notice or notification message to your mobile phone. You will have the option of accepting or declining the Software Update before applying the Software. Your mobile phone will also automatically apply the installed Software at midnight (“Automatic updates” function). You can decline these “Check automatically” and “Automatic updates” functions at [Settings – System - Update center - Software Update - Overflow menu - Settings]. Please note that if you decline Check automatically, you are effectively declining to allow any future Software Updates.

If your mobile phone is already in use and you decline to perform a Software Update, please note that failure to install updated Software may result in a [deterioration of the performance of your mobile phone, compatibility issues with new or existing apps, and other issues with the features or security of your mobile phone].

In addition, you may withdraw consent to any further collection of your personal information simply by disabling the “Check automatically” and “Automatic updates” functions on your mobile phone, which are described above. These functions may be accessed at [Settings – System - Update center - Software Update - Overflow menu - Settings]. 
However, please note that if you disable the Check automatically and Automatic updates functions, it may affect or restrict the operation of your mobile phone or services, in part or in whole. The collection and use of information, as described above, is necessary for the optimal operation of your mobile phone. 

If you have any queries about your right to refuse consent or how to withdraw it, please contact us at mc.customer-service@lge.com.

b.	Urgent Software Updates
If the circumstances require, we may perform a Software Update pursuant to our legitimate interests, without providing our customers with any individual notification or seeking their consent, regardless of the current device settings (an “Urgent Software Update”). Examples of circumstances that may require an Urgent Software Update include threats to customer safety or data security, or operational issues that may result in a significant disruption of our services, or the imminent likelihood of such circumstances.

3.	Information LGE may collect from you
In performing a Software Update, LGE may collect the following items of information from your mobile phone: International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), serial number, mobile phone model, software and/or firmware versions, phone operating system, mobile country code (MCC), mobile network code (MNC), Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) identifier and selected language. This information is collected automatically as part of the process of performing a Software Update.

As part of our role in providing cellular services to your mobile phone, we will collect operational information, including system logs with IP addresses. This information is collected automatically and is a necessary part of the operation of the phone.

4.	How LGE uses the personal information it collects from you

-	To analyze, review and improve our products and services.

The legal basis for LGEs’ processing of your personal information will typically be one of the following:
-	Contract: where it is necessary to perform a contract with you;
-	Legitimate interests: where it is necessary for LGE’s own purposes or for a third party’s legitimate business interests. For LGE, this will include its interests as a consumer electronics products manufacturer and service provider;
-	Consent: where you have chosen to provide consent. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time; or
-	Legal obligation: where the processing of information is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations.

We may also use the aggregate statistical data collected during a Software Update and during the operation of the mobile phone to better understand our customers’ needs and to improve our customer care and our products and services, as well as for the purpose of market research and analytics. Such aggregate statistical data do not contain information that identifies or may be attributed to natural persons.

5.	Cases in which LGE shares personal information with other parties
We do not generally share with any third parties the information we collect during the Software Update, including any information that identifies or may be attributed to natural persons. Nevertheless, please be aware of the following circumstances where we may share such information with the following third parties:

-	Affiliates and Subsidiaries. LGE may share personal information and non-personal information (including mobile phone information) with its affiliates and subsidiaries around the world only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it is collected. The term ‘affiliates’ or ‘subsidiaries’ refers to group companies who may be using the LG name or who have common ownership or control, such as LG CNS or LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc.;
-	Third Party Service Providers. To third-party vendors that LGE may engage to provide services on its behalf from time to time, such as to fulfil customer service requests;

While we generally do not share the information with additional third parties, please note that in the following specific circumstances, we may further share the information with the following entities:
-	Other Parties When Required by Law. As required by a court order or other governmental or law enforcement authorities in order to comply with due legal process or law;
-	Other Parties in Connection with Corporate Transactions. In connection with a corporate event, such as a merger, restructuring, sale or transfer of all or a part of LGE’s business (including that of a division or subsidiary), in the event that LGE needs to disclose information to a potential buyer and its professional advisors;
-	Other Parties When It Is Necessary to Protect Our Service. To enforce our contractual rights, take precautions against liability, investigate suspected or known illegal activities, or to investigate or defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; or
-	Other Parties When It Is Necessary to Protect Our Customers’ Personal Safety or Property. In order to protect the rights, personal safety or property of our customers or the public.

Under no circumstances will your personal information collected during the Software Update be processed for marketing purposes without your consent, nor will it be shared with third parties for marketing purposes without your consent.

6.	Overseas transfers of personal data
We, our affiliates, subsidiaries and service providers may use your personal information in countries other than where your mobile phone is located, for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. The data protection laws of some countries may not offer the same level of protection as those of the country in which you are located. However, before transferring your personal information, we will take steps to ensure that such information will be afforded the same level of protection in the recipient country or jurisdiction.

7.	Period of retention of personal information
We will keep your personal information for as long as is necessary for us to provide you with the Application or for other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We apply criteria to determine the appropriate retention period for different categories of personal information you provide us with.
It is essential for the company to collect and use personal information in order to provide software update services. Please note that the use/provision of many parts of the service may be restricted if you do not agree to the collection. We collect and use personal information from the information subject and keep it until the purpose of such collection and use is fulfilled. Therefore, the Company uses and stores personal information during the period of using the service.
If you wish to request the deletion of your personal information because it is no longer required, or due to an objection to its processing, or due to a claim that it has been processed unlawfully, you have the right to seek the restriction of its processing while we verify your request for deletion.

8.	Security
We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality and security of your personal information. Nevertheless, due to the design of the Internet, constantly changing technology, and other factors beyond our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties or that we will not be subject to security breaches. We do not accept any responsibility for the disclosure of personal information resulting from errors in transmission or from unauthorized or unlawful acts of third parties.

9.	Protecting the Privacy of Children
Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. For that reason, none of our Services are directed at or designed to attract anyone under 16 years old or the corresponding age in the relevant jurisdiction. We also do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from users who are under 16 years old, or the corresponding age in the relevant jurisdiction. Should we learn or be notified that we have collected information from users under the age of 16 or the corresponding age in the relevant jurisdiction, we will promptly delete such personal information.

10.	Changes to LGE’s Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated by LGE from time to time. If we make a material change to our Privacy Policy, we will update you via mobile device or other means. You may be required to acknowledge or agree to the revised Privacy Policy to continue using the Software Updates Service.

If permitted by law, a small fee for providing you with such a service may be charged. Please note that we may decline to process your requests if they are unreasonably abusive, jeopardize the privacy of others, or are extremely impractical (where permitted under applicable law).
