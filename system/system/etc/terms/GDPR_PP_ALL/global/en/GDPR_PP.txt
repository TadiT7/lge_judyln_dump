1.	Introduction

This Policy applies only to information collected by LGE from your LGE mobile phone to perform an update of firmware via a Firmware Over-the-Air (“FOTA”) process (a “Software Update”). This Policy does not apply to any other products or services of LGE, including mobile apps offered or provided by LGE. This Policy also does not apply to any products or services offered by third parties, including operating system providers, other content or application providers or your network carrier. Products and services outside the scope of this Privacy Policy have their own policies that apply to the collection, use, and sharing of information, and we encourage you to read those policies. LGE is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices of third parties.

If you have recently purchased this mobile phone, it is necessary to perform a Software Update as described in this Privacy Policy before use, in order to ensure that your mobile phone functions properly and has our most up-to-date features, functionality and security settings. If you have any questions, please contact us as provided in this Policy.

This Policy is available for your review at any time at [Settings – System – About phone – Legal info – Legal Documents for LG Software – Privacy Policy].

Any translation of this Privacy Policy is done for local requirements and in the event of a discrepancy between the English and any non-English version, the English version of this Policy shall govern, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in your jurisdiction.

2.	Overview of FOTA Software Updates
From time to time, the LGE firmware on your mobile phone (the “Software”) may require updates or supplements provided by LGE, or LGE may provide add-on components to the Software. Performing a Software Update will install new Software on your mobile phone in order to supply these updates, supplements or add-on components. Software Updates may add new features or functions and, in limited cases, may remove existing features or functions. After completing the Software Update, you may no longer use and may not be able to roll back to the previous installed version of the Software. 

Because the Software Update is performed via a FOTA process, additional charges may apply if you download new Software over a cellular network, depending on your network carrier and service plan. If you wish to avoid any use of cellular network data for Software Updates, please select the “Wi-Fi only” option under Settings. 

a.	Your options for managing future Software Updates
With the “Check automatically” function enabled, your mobile phone will check for new or updated Software from time to time and automatically install new or updated Software when it is available (“Check automatically” function). After the Software is installed, we will alert you using a pop-up notice or a notification message on your mobile phone. You will have the option to accept or decline the Software Update before applying the Software. Your mobile phone will also automatically apply the installed Software at midnight (“Automatic updates” function). You can decline these “Check automatically” and “Automatic updates” functions at [Settings – System – Update Center – Software Update - Overflow menu - Settings].  If you decline Check automatically, you are effectively declining to perform future Software Updates.
If your mobile phone is already in use and you decline to perform a Software Update, please note that failure to install updated Software may result in [degradation of performance of your mobile phone, compatibility issues with new or existing apps, and other issues with features or security of your mobile phone].

In addition, you may withdraw consent to further collection of your personal information by disabling the “Check automatically” and “Automatic updates” functions on your mobile phone, which are described above. These functions may be accessed at [Settings – System – Update Center – Software Update - Overflow menu - Settings]. However, please understand that if you disable the Check automatically and Automatic updates functions, it may affect or restrict the operation of your mobile phone or services, in part or in whole. The collection and use of the information, as described above, is necessary for the optimal operation of your mobile phone. 

If you have any questions about your right to refuse or how to withdraw consent, please contact us at mc.customer-service@lge.com.

b.	Urgent Software Updates
If circumstances require, we may perform a Software Update pursuant to our legitimate interests, without providing individual notification or seeking consent, and regardless of current device settings (an “Urgent Software Update”). Examples of circumstances that may require an Urgent Software Update include threats to customer safety or data security, or operational issues that may result in significant disruption of services, or imminent likelihood of such circumstances.
