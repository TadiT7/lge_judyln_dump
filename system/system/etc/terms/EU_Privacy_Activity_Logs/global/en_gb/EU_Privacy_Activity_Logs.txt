We, our affiliates, subsidiaries, and suppliers may use information (including your personal information) in countries other than the area where your device is located in connection with providing you with our LG Device Diagnostics Report Services and any other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The data protection laws in many of these countries may not offer the same level of protection as those in the country where you are located.

For further information on how we handle and protect your Personal information, please contact us at mc.customer-service@lge.com.

For example, we will keep information necessary to protect us in a legal claim, such as information related to a contract, for the lifetime of the contract and up to one year after. After this period, it will be deleted or anonymised in some cases. Where we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no other lawful basis to continue with such processing, if you subsequently withdraw your consent, then we will delete your personal information.
If you request the erasure of your personal information because it is no longer needed, or based on an objection to the processing or a claim that the processing is unlawful, you have the right to seek the restrictions of processing while we verify your request for erasure.

7. Security
We exert commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality and security of your personal information. Nevertheless, due to the design of the Internet, ever-changing technology, and other factors beyond our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties or that we will not be subject to security breaches. We do not assume any responsibility for the disclosure of personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized or unlawful acts of third parties.

8. Protecting the Privacy of Children
Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. For that reason, none of our Services are directed at or designed to attract anyone below 16 years or in the age of majority in the relevant jurisdiction. Neither do we knowingly collect or maintain personal information from users below 16 years or in the age of majority in the relevant jurisdiction. Upon learning or receiving notification that we have collected information from users below 16 years or in the age of majority in the relevant jurisdiction, we will promptly delete such personal information.

9. Changes to LGE’s Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated by LGE from time to time. If we make a material change to our Privacy Policy, we will update you via Services or other means. You may be required to acknowledge or agree to the revised Privacy Policy to continue using the Services.

10. Accessing Your Information and Your Rights

If permitted by laws, a small fee may be charged for providing you with such service. Please note that we may decline to process your requests if they are unreasonably abusive, harmful to the privacy of others, or extremely impractical (where permitted under the applicable law). For further information, or to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at mc.customer-service@lge.com.
