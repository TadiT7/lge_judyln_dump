16.DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR UNITED STATES RESIDENTS.
(a)Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and LGE in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and LGE agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this EULA shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this EULA. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND LGE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

(b)Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 16(a), we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. 

(c)Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and LGE will be governed by the "AAA Rules" of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this EULA, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting LGE.

(d)Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). LGE's address for Notice is: LG Electronics, USA, Inc. Attn: Legal Department-Arbitration, 1000 Sylvan Avenue Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or LGE may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or LGE shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.

(e)Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, LGE will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $25,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse LGE for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

(f)No Class Actions. YOU AND LGE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and LGE agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

(g)Opt-Out. You may opt out of this dispute resolution procedure. If you opt out, neither you nor LG can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must send notice to LG no later than 30 calendar days from the date of first consumer purchaser’s purchase of the product by either: (i) sending an e-mail to [optout@lge.com], with the subject line: “Arbitration Opt Out” or (ii) calling [1-800-980-2973]. You must include in the opt-out e-mail or by telephone: (a) your name and address; (b) the date on which the Service was activated; and (c) the date on which the Service was terminated; (d) the product model name or model number; and (e) the IMEI or MEID or Serial Number, as applicable (the IMEI or MEID or Serial Number can be found by removing the battery from your device as explained in the User Guide). Email and telephone are the only two forms of notice that will be effective to opt out of this dispute resolution procedure. If you do not opt out, then you accept all terms and conditions of the Limited Warranty, including the binding arbitration provision described above.  

(h)Modifications. In the event that LGE makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to LGE's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to LGE's address for Notice, in which case your account with LGE shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.
